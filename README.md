# SHAWN YAT SIN
## About Me 🌱
My name is Shawn and I am a 4th year at McGill University 🇨🇦 where I major in Software Engineering. I enjoy tackling new projects, collaborating with others, and learning new technologies. Currently, I am completing a full-stack web development bootcamp, grinding leetcode, and learning C++ in my spare time. I also plan on participating in a hackathon and taking a machine learning class in the winter semester. 

Outside of work and academics, I spend my time staying active through community sports such as volleyball 🏐 and dragonboat 🐉 as well as working out 💪 at home and skateboarding 🛹 or biking 🚴 around the neighborhood. I am also part of the Hong Kong Student Network as VP Internal at McGill and had the pleasure of taking Japanese and Korean courses.
